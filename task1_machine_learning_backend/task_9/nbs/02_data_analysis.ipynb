I think that the whole thing was announced at a relatively large meeting. [00:43:59] It was a nationwide organization that had someone in charge of the church in every state and then in every city and then in every subdivided among cities because we met in homes. We basically had small groups for a normal church. It's what we did all the time, but we occasionally had larger meetings. I think his resignation was announced at a larger meeting there. What I remember very clearly is just the drive back with my father who was just, I think, devastated and angry. I don't actually remember him saying anything other than I remember very clearly having the sense that we were never going back. He wasn't. Somewhere in there I decided that I was not either. [00:45:06] I guess I remember that portion more clearly than an actual single revelation.</br>THERAPIST: Did you miss it? (pause)</br>CLIENT: Yeah. I think so. \n",

A debt is a very bad thing, particularly when mismanaged. There are times when debt is a useful tool this is my adult statement. Certainly when you're trying to help a whole bunch of people self-actualize, helping them to figure out how to pay off their debts is a really good thing to do. When that turns into &quot;having any debt is a huge sin and makes you unfit to be in charge of anything&quot; and mortgages are a type of debt, then maybe we're not in a very healthy system any longer.

[00:31:00] (pause)</br>THERAPIST: I see my role in a very general way as helping you make sense of your experience. It's especially challenging when it feels like your experience makes no sense. (pause) [00:32:39]</br>CLIENT: I guess I feel like I can make sense of what I have experienced, but I don't have the good sense of what that means for what will come next. So I guess in that sense, the experience doesn't make sense.</br>THERAPIST: I'm thinking more about your question about what my role is. What are your thoughts about even what led your mind to go to there?</br>CLIENT: We spent a lot of this session in silence, which is not usually how it goes. [ ] (inaudible at 00:33:28) (pause) That means something about what you're doing and what I'm doing and that itself is some sort of way point or indicator of something in terms of trying to make sense of experience. And that was why having this experience of this session going radically differently from how several others have gone from my end and trying to figure out why. [00:34:14] It hasn't been bad; it's been good just different.</br>THERAPIST: Was part of the question wondering how I can help you or what I can do to help you?</br>CLIENT: Yeah, I absolutely wonder what you are doing or can do or will do. Yeah. Yeah. Not in the frustrated sense of why aren't you doing something? More in the sense of the curiosity sense, if that makes sense. [00:34:58]</br>THERAPIST: The other reaction I had, which it doesn't sound like that's where you're going, but I almost heard it as your need to figure out for me what my role is. My thought was, &quot;Don't worry about me. I'm okay. I can take care of myself. Worry about you.&quot; That was my thought that you needed, in a sense, to take responsibility or help me figure out what I need in my role. And I'm not sure if that's what it meant, that was just my . . .</br>CLIENT: I don't think that was what it meant, but I won't discount the possibility. This is a very strange relationship for me. (chuckles) I strive not to be in such vastly non-reciprocal relationships most of the time, so I think I was doing it more in the &quot;what is going on what are you doing&quot; sense. [00:36:09] That's the disclaimer. I'm not sure.</br>THERAPIST: That's interesting, right?
