# Exploratory Data Analysis over the transcripts

Here some general instructions. Make sure you have a seperate environment and run 
the notebooks in order to install the necessary libraries. I have structured the 
notebooks so that all cells which have an ```#EXPORT``` in it are exportet to a
```.py``` file which then can be imported. So you don't have to repeat yourself.

Once I am happy with the analysis I may do a pull request.
